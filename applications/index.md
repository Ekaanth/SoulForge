## Important Notes

1. **Grant Independence**: While some links may point to established projects, please note that SoulForge grant applications are often independent initiatives, separate from other work conducted by the teams.

2. **Terminations**: This page includes information about grants terminated due to breaches of the SoulForge grant program terms. However, it's important to note that teams may choose to discontinue work on a grant for various reasons without terminating the project itself. Such decisions are not reflected in this overview.

3. **Application vs. Delivery**: There is a clear distinction between a grant application being accepted and the successful delivery of the project. Acceptance does not guarantee successful completion.

4. **Public Announcements**: Only teams that have successfully delivered a milestone are authorized to make public announcements about their SoulForge grant.

5. **Regular Updates**: This page is updated regularly to reflect the most current status of each grant project.
