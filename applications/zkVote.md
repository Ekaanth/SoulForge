# zkVote

## [Section 1] Information

- **Project Name:** zkVote
- **Payment Details:** 0xA1B2C3D4E5F6... **Network**: [Ethereum]
- **Total Amount Requested:** 15,000 USDC

## [Section 2] Project Overview :page_facing_up:

- **Brief Description:**  
  zkVote is a decentralized voting system that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to ensure voter privacy and result integrity. The project aims to provide a transparent and tamper-proof voting mechanism for DAOs and other decentralized organizations.

- **Core Idea:**  
  The primary goal is to create a voting system using Circom circuits for ballot casting and vote counting. Each vote is accompanied by a zk-SNARK proof to ensure validity without revealing the voter's choice. Key components include:
  - **Voter Registration:** Circuits to verify voter eligibility without exposing personal information.
  - **Ballot Casting:** Circuits to validate votes and generate zk-SNARK proofs.
  - **Vote Tallying:** Circuits to count votes and prove the correctness of the final tally.
  - **Proof Verification:** On-chain verification of zk-SNARKs for each voting action.

- **Technology Stack:**  
  - **Circom:** For creating zero-knowledge proof circuits for voter actions and result tabulation.
  - **Smart Contracts:** For managing the voting process and verifying proofs on-chain.
  - **IPFS:** For storing encrypted ballots off-chain.

## [Section 3] Ecosystem Fit

- **Similar Projects:**  
  While there are existing blockchain voting systems, zkVote distinguishes itself by using zero-knowledge proofs to provide a higher level of privacy and verifiability throughout the entire voting process.

- **Unique Contribution:**  
  zkVote addresses the need for truly anonymous yet verifiable voting in decentralized governance. It combines the transparency of blockchain with the privacy guarantees of zk-proofs, filling a crucial gap in current DAO voting mechanisms.

## [Section 5] Development Roadmap :open_book:

### Milestone 1 — Core Voting Mechanism

- **Estimated Duration:** 6 weeks
- **Description:** Develop Circom circuits for voter registration, ballot casting, and basic vote tallying. Implement smart contracts for on-chain proof verification.
- **FTE:** 2
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD [Covers circuit development, smart contract creation, and initial testing.]

### Milestone 2 — Advanced Features and Deployment

- **Estimated Duration:** 6 weeks
- **Description:** Implement advanced features such as delegated voting, multiple choice ballots, and result audit trails. Deploy the system on testnet and conduct security audits.
- **FTE:** 2
- **Costs:** 7,000 USD [Includes feature development, extensive testing, audit costs, and testnet deployment.]

## [Section 6] Extended Scope

- **Future Plans:**  
  zkVote aims to become the standard for secure and private voting in the Web3 ecosystem. Future plans include:
  - Integration with major DAO frameworks and governance tokens.
  - Development of a user-friendly interface for non-technical voters.
  - Expansion to support complex voting mechanisms like quadratic voting and conviction voting.
  - Collaboration with academic institutions to further research in zk-proof applications for democratic processes.
