# zkChess

## [Section 1] Information

- **Project Name:** zkChess
- **Payment Details:** 0x45rtHu78hv49... **Network** : [Polygon]
- **Total Amount Requested:** 12,000 USDC

## [Section 2] Project Overview :page_facing_up:

- **Brief Description:**  
  zkChess is a decentralized chess game utilizing Circom to handle game logic and validation via zero-knowledge proofs. The project aims to offer a transparent, fair, and secure chess experience on chain.

- **Core Idea:**  
 **Core Idea:** The primary goal is to create a chess game with Circom circuits for move validation and game state management. Each move and state change generates zk-SNARK proofs to ensure correctness and privacy. Components include:
  -  **Move Validation:** Circuits to verify legal moves and generate zk-SNARK proofs. 
  -  **Game State Management:** Circuits to handle and validate game state updates.
 -  **Proof Generation:** zk-SNARKs for every action, submitted to the chain for integrity and privacy.

- **Technology Stack:**  
  - **Circom:** For creating zero-knowledge proof circuits to handle game moves and state verification.
  - **Smart Contracts:** For game management and player interactions on chain.

## [Section 3] Ecosystem Fit

- **Similar Projects:**  
  While traditional chess games exist on the blockchain, zkChess differentiates itself by using zero-knowledge proofs to ensure move validity and game state integrity. No existing projects use this approach to the same extent.

- **Unique Contribution:**  
  zkChess fills a gap by combining zk-proof technology with blockchain gaming, offering enhanced privacy and verifiability in chess gameplay, which is currently underexplored in the Circom landscape.
