   1. The **[SoulForge Grants Committee](/docs/Introduction/team.md#soulforge-grants-committee)** reviews applications and may request changes or clarifications. These changes will be addressed within the same pull request.
   2. Applicants should address feedback by modifying their application and commenting when done. Applications inactive for **2 weeks may be closed**, but can be reopened if not rejected.
   3. Once all requested changes are addressed and the proposal meets the required standards, it is marked as **'ready for review'**. At this stage, the application is merged into the main repository and shared with the entire SoulForge Grants Committee for final evaluation.
   4. After the application pull request is merged, it is shared internally with the SoulForge Grants Evaluators and Committee for final decision-making. We aim to provide results within **14-20 days**. If you haven't heard back after this period, it likely indicates that the application did not pass internal review. However, we strive to communicate outcomes for all applications, regardless of the decision.
