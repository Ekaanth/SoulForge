   Milestone progress is tracked through the project's GitHub repository. Upon completion of a milestone, the SoulForge team conducts a 30-minute review call with the project team. If the milestone is approved, the grant team is notified, and milestone payments are processed as outlined in the original application.

   The review process ensures that all deliverables meet the agreed-upon standards and that the project is progressing as planned. This collaborative approach allows for open communication and timely feedback between the SoulForge team and grant recipients.
