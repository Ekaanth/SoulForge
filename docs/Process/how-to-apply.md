The grants are distributed in milestones, with disbursements occurring upon the completion of 85% of the defined milestones. The grants will be distributed in USDT or USDC and sent to KYC/AML verified wallets, preferably exchange wallets. The funds are strictly to be used for the development and testing of the application and may also be utilized to incentivize open source contributions. The grants must not be used for any DeFi activities.

## How to apply:

Follow these steps carefully to submit your grant application:

1. Familiarize yourself with the program:
   - Read our [FAQs](../faq.md) to understand common questions about the grants program.
   - Review our [project ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jl3ofy0jNSe3yQkVpsMO59_mIxoLljEVViNsVoBKzlI) document to get inspiration and understand what types of projects we're looking for.

2. Prepare your application:
   - [Fork](https://github.com/zk-bankai/SoulForge) our SoulForge grants program repository on GitHub.
   - In your forked repository, navigate to the `applications` folder.
   - Create a copy of the [application template](https://github.com/zk-bankai/SoulForge/blob/main/applications/application-template.md). 
     **Important:** Do not modify the original template file.
   - Name your new file `project_name.md`, replacing "project_name" with your actual project name.

3. Fill out your application:
   - Open your newly created `project_name.md` file.
   - Carefully fill out each section of the template with details about your project.
   - Be as thorough as possible in describing your project, especially the deliverables.
   - Clearly outline the scope and expected outcomes of your project.
   - The more detailed information you provide, the easier it will be for the review committee to evaluate your proposal.

4. Submit your application:
   - Once you've completed your application, commit the changes to your forked repository.
   - Create a pull request to the main branch of SoulForge repository.
   - Ensure that your pull request contains only one new file: the `project_name.md` file you created and filled out.

5. Wait for review:
   - The review committee will evaluate your application and may provide feedback or ask for clarifications.
   - Be prepared to respond to any questions or make adjustments to your proposal if requested.

By following these steps carefully, you'll ensure that your application is submitted correctly and has the best chance of being considered for a grant.
