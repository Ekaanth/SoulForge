# Building Open-Source Projects

As part of the SoulForge Rewards Program, all projects funded through our grants must be open-sourced. This document outlines the guidelines and rules for building and maintaining open-source projects.

## Open-Source Requirements

1. **Licensing**: All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced under one of the following licenses:
   - Apache 2.0
   - GPLv3
   - MIT
   - Unlicense
   Include a `LICENSE` file in the root directory with the full text of the chosen license.

2. **Repository Structure**:
   - Maintain a clear and organized directory structure.
   - Include a comprehensive `README.md` file in the root directory.
   - Provide a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with guidelines for contributors.
   - Include a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file to ensure a welcoming community.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear and detailed documentation for your project.
   - Include installation instructions, usage examples, and API references where applicable.
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with each release or significant change.

4. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git for version control.
   - Maintain a clear branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow or GitHub Flow).
   - Tag releases with semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0).

5. **Continuous Integration and Testing**:
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI).
   - Maintain a comprehensive test suite with high code coverage.
   - Ensure all tests pass before merging pull requests.

6. **Code Quality**:
   - Adhere to consistent coding standards and style guides.
   - Use linters and formatters to maintain code quality.
   - Conduct regular code reviews for all contributions.

7. **Security**:
   - Regularly update dependencies to address vulnerabilities.
   - Implement security best practices in your code.
   - Provide a clear process for reporting security issues.

8. **Community Engagement**:
   - Respond promptly to issues and pull requests.
   - Maintain active communication channels (e.g., Discord, mailing lists).
   - Provide clear guidelines for community contributions.

9. **Transparency**:
   - Clearly communicate the project's roadmap and goals.
   - Be open about the project's limitations and known issues.
   - Provide regular updates on project status and milestones.

10. **Attribution**:
    - Properly attribute all contributors to the project.
    - Respect and acknowledge any third-party libraries or resources used.

## Best Practices for Building Open-Source Projects

1. **Start with a Clear Vision**: Define the purpose and goals of your project from the outset.

2. **Modular Design**: Build your project with modularity in mind to facilitate easier maintenance and contributions.

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Invest time in creating thorough documentation to help users and potential contributors.

4. **Automated Testing**: Implement automated testing to ensure code reliability and ease the contribution process.

5. **Semantic Versioning**: Use semantic versioning to clearly communicate changes and maintain backwards compatibility.

6. **Issue Templates**: Provide issue templates to standardize bug reports and feature requests.

7. **Contributor Guidelines**: Create clear guidelines for how others can contribute to your project.

8. **Code of Conduct**: Establish and enforce a code of conduct to foster a positive community.

9. **Regular Maintenance**: Consistently review and update your project to keep it relevant and secure.

10. **Community Building**: Actively engage with your user base and encourage contributions from the community.

By adhering to these rules and following these best practices, you'll create a robust, maintainable, and community-friendly open-source project that aligns with the SoulForge Rewards Program's goals.
