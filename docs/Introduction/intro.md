# SoulForge Grant Program Guidelines

## Introduction

The SoulForge grants program is part of our commitment to the zero-knowledge (zk) landscape. We are excited to offer a comprehensive grants program focused on supporting development, research, and education efforts related to **[Plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3) and [circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom)**, supported by **Polygon Labs ðŸ’œ**.

## Program Focus

While applications are open to all, we prioritize:
- Projects with a **strong technical focus**
- Initiatives that demonstrably add value to the Plonky3 or circom ecosystem
- Applicants with a solid and compelling long-term roadmap
- Work that shows clear significance to the community

## Project Types

### Research-oriented projects
- Demonstrate potential impact through academic publications
- Show community engagement metrics

### Open-source projects
- Prove experience in building strong communities
- Provide evidence of user adoption and active development contributions

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project has a higher chance of acceptance if it:

1. Presents a **well-researched** or tested concept with prior work
2. Demonstrates clear **benefits to the zk ecosystem** and its users
3. Shows commitment to **long-term maintenance** after grant completion
4. Has a team with **proven experience** in relevant technologies
5. Provides an application **rich in technical details**
6. Implements technology that's **unique** or doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet
7. Stands out among competitors or implements novel technology

## Requirements

All projects must:

- Open-source all code produced (Apache 2.0 preferred; GPLv3, MIT, or Unlicense acceptable)
- Not rely on closed-source software for full functionality
- Not have been the object of a successful token sale
- Focus on software implementation/research, not specific tokens or ventures
- Complete KYC/KYB checks for all beneficiaries

## Documentation

- All projects must create clear, written documentation explaining how the project works
- Tutorials or videos are encouraged as supplementary materials to help new users

## Restrictions

We do not fund projects that:
- Have ongoing grants (finish current before applying for new)
- Encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or criminal activities
- Actively promote tokens or specific cryptocurrencies

## Licensing and Attribution

- We take licensing and attribution seriously
- Using others' work without proper attribution will lead to immediate termination
- Contact us if you have questions about license compliance

## Application Process

1. Read the FAQ to understand the program's subtleties
2. Fork the SoulForge grants program repository
3. Create a copy of the application template
4. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`
5. Fill out the template with detailed project information
6. Create a pull request with only the new Markdown file
7. Address any comments or requested changes from the committee
8. Wait for the application to be marked as 'ready for review'
9. Upon approval, your application will be accepted and merged

## Review Process

1. The SoulForge Grants Committee will review applications
2. Committee members may request changes or clarifications
3. Applicants should address feedback by modifying their application
4. Applications inactive for 2 weeks may be closed, but can be reopened
5. Accepted applications will be merged within 14-20 days of being marked 'ready for review'

## Delivery and Payment

- Milestones are monitored via the project's GitHub account
- Upon milestone completion, a 30-minute review call will be scheduled
- Grants are distributed in milestones, with payments made after 85% completion
- Funds are distributed in USDT or USDC to KYC/AML verified wallets
- Grants must be used for development, testing, and open-source contributions only

## Support

While we don't provide hands-on support, we will try to direct you to the correct resources if you face specific issues during development. We encourage you to join the [community](https://t.me/zkbankai) for help and updates.

Remember: The goal is to create valuable, open-source contributions to the zk ecosystem that explore and build with Plonky3 and circom!
