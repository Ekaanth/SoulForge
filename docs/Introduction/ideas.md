# Project Ideas for SoulForge Grants

## Overview

We are interested in funding a wide range of projects that contribute to the ZK Technology Stack. This document provides guidance on the types of projects we're looking for and how to approach your application.


## Types of Projects

1. **New Projects**: You can propose an entirely new project that addresses a need in the ZK ecosystem.

2. **Porting Existing Work**: 
   - You don't need to start a new project to be eligible for a grant.
   - Consider porting existing work to Plonky3 or Circom, where licenses allow.

3. **Contributing to Existing Open-Source Projects**:
   - You can propose contributions to existing open-source projects.
   - Important: Check with the project maintainers beforehand to ensure they're interested in your contribution.
   - Note: Acceptance of your milestones will generally be tied to the inclusion of your work in the project.

4. **Maintenance Grants**: 
   - We also offer grants for maintaining crucial open-source projects.
