# Frequently Asked Questions

## 🧭 General

### How do I apply for a SoulForge grant?

Please refer to our detailed **["How to Apply"](Process/how-to-apply.md)** guide for step-by-step instructions on submitting your application.

### Is there a maximum grant amount I can request?

While there's no strict upper limit, larger grant requests undergo more rigorous scrutiny. We evaluate each application based on its potential impact and feasibility.

### What types of projects does SoulForge fund?

We primarily support software development and research activities that benefit the zk ecosystem. Our focus is on technical development and innovation, particularly in Plonky3 and circom. We typically don't fund:
- Business-oriented activities (e.g., marketing, business planning)
- Events or outreach programs
- Deployment, hosting costs, or maintenance for non-infrastructure projects
- Audits
- Time spent learning Circom or Plonky (we expect a baseline understanding)

### Who is eligible to apply for a SoulForge grant?

We welcome applications from individuals and teams committed to advancing the zk ecosystem. However, we do not fund:
- Projects involved in or planning a token sale
- Projects promoting gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or any criminal activities

### Does SoulForge offer upfront payments?

Our standard process is milestone-based payments. However, if you have a compelling need for upfront funding, please contact the team directly to discuss your situation.

### When are grant payments issued?

Payments are made within 14 days after a milestone is successfully delivered and officially accepted by the Grants team. This requires submission according to our delivery guidelines and a thorough review by our team.

### Can I incorporate existing open-source code in my project?

We encourage leveraging existing open-source libraries and projects, provided you comply with their licenses. Please ensure proper attribution and adherence to license requirements. Any license violations will result in immediate grant termination.

### My application was rejected. What are my options?

We provide specific feedback on rejections and are open to working with you to improve your application. If you believe there's been a misunderstanding, please initiate a conversation with the SoulForge team.

### I believe a SoulForge grantee is misusing my code. What should I do?

Please contact us immediately with details of the potential license violation. We take intellectual property rights seriously and will investigate promptly.

### Why are some applications processed faster than others?

Application processing times vary based on factors such as:
- Complexity and technical depth of the proposal
- Need for specialized external evaluation
- Clarity and completeness of the application
- Current workload of the evaluation team
- Level of innovation and potential impact

## 🖊️ Application Process

### What's the typical timeline from application to decision?

While straightforward, high-impact proposals can be approved within a week, most applications involve discussion and refinement. We aim to provide initial feedback within 14-20 days. Applications without activity for two weeks may be closed, but can be reopened if not rejected.

### Why is KYC/KYB required, and how is this information handled?

To comply with regulations, we must verify the identity of grant recipients through Know Your Customer (KYC) for individuals and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks for entities. This information is handled confidentially and securely. We're exploring more user-friendly ways to manage this process in the future.

## 🥳 After Approval

### What if I can't complete my project on time?

We understand that delays can occur. The best approach is to communicate with us proactively about any changes to your timeline. We can often amend your application or adjust milestones. While we reserve the right to terminate agreements that fall significantly behind schedule, our goal is to support your success, not penalize you for minor setbacks.

### Can I list SoulForge as a partner or use your logo?

You may display our grants badge in project-specific contexts (e.g., the grant project repository) after your first milestone is accepted. However, you cannot list SoulForge as a general partner or use our logo for broader promotional purposes.

### Does SoulForge provide marketing support for grantees?

While we don't offer direct PR services, we do showcase our grantees' work. We regularly announce projects, their descriptions, and milestone completions on our [zk-bankai Twitter account](https://x.com/zk_bankai). This provides visibility within the zk community for your innovative work.
