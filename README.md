## :wave: Introduction

As part of our commitment to zero-knowledge(zk) landscape, we are amped to bring a comprehensive grants program focused on Supporting development, research and eduction efforts related to **Plonky3, and Circom** Supported by **Polygon Labs ðŸ’œ**.

 For more information about zkBankai, please visit our page [here](https://zkbankai.com/about/).

### Guidelines

Everyone is welcome to apply for a grant. Projects part of this program[  **SoulForge**] are broad in scope, but our focus lies on strong **technical** projects that are keen to expore and build with **Plonky3, and Circom**. 

**Below are the guidelines,It must fulfill the following requirements:** 

- All code/research reports produced as part of a grant must be **open-sourced**, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT, or Unlicense are also acceptable.

- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.

- Applications must not mention a specific token. Furthermore, the focus of the application should lie on the software that is being implemented/research being carried out as part of the grant and less on your project/venture/operation. For the purpose of the application and delivery, think about how others might also benefit from your work.

- As a general rule, teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or criminal activities in general.


> **Generally, your project will have better chances to be accepted if:**

- It presents a **well-researched/detailed** thoughts, for which, ideally, you are able to show some prior work.

- You can demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side.

- Your team has **proven experience** with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. You maybe asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application. 

- Your application is **rich in technical details** and well-defined.

- You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.

Finally, we take licensing and the right of all teams in and outside the ecosystem to be recognised for their work very seriously. Using others' work with no attribution or indication that this was not your own work as part of a milestone delivery **will lead to immediate termination**. Please reach out to us before submitting if you have any doubts on how to comply with a specific license and we'll be happy to help.


### Project Ideas

An overview of existing projects in the zkBankai Technology Stack, along with broad project ideas we would potentially be interested in funding, can be found [here](/docs/build-open-source.md), as well as a list of previously accepted applications [here](/applications/index.md).

Finally, you don't need to start your own project in order to be eligible for a grant. Instead, some teams choose to port existing work to Plonky3, or Circom, where the pertinent licenses allow, or even to contribute to an existing open-source project. In the latter case, you should check in advance that the maintainers of the project are interested in your contribution, and the acceptance of the milestones will generally be tied to the inclusion of your work in said project.

If you have a **good concept of the technical challenges** that your idea entails and would like feedback/input before submitting it, you can send us an [email](mailto:gm@zkbankai.com) and tell us about it.

### Support

The scope of our Grants Programs consists of funding and feedback on delivered milestones. This means that we do not provide hands-on support as part of a grant, but if you face specific issues during development, we will do our best and try to direct you to the correct resources with the mentors of the project. You can find general documentation and more information on [Plonky3](https://docs.polygon.technology/innovation-design/plonky/), and [Circom](https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/concepts/circom-intro-brief/), and we encourage you to join the [community](https://t.me/zkbankai) in order to get help with specific issues or to stay up to date with the most recent developments.

For questions about the grants program itself, see our [FAQ](docs/faq.md#frequently-asked-questions).

### Team

#### SoulForge Grants Committee<!-- omit in toc -->

The committee consists of prominent individuals and organizations, With our aim to forster more advancement and exploration to [**Plonky3, and Circom**] we have an independent board of individuals committed to the advancement of zkBankai ecosystem and is responsible for evaluating grant applications and providing feedback on these.

In cases where a niche expert opinion is desirable, one of the committee members may request such a review.

#### SoulForge Grants Evaluators

Evaluators are individuals able to evaluate the technology delivered as a result of the Grants Program. The committee has the right to add or remove evaluators on the basis of super majority.

## :pencil: Process

> **:loudspeaker:** The grants are distributed in milestones, with disbursements occurring upon the completion of 85% of the defined milestones. The grants will be distributed in USDT or USDC and sent to KYC/AML verified wallets, preferably exchange wallets. The funds are strictly to be used for the development and testing of the application and may also be utilized to incentivize open source contributions. The grants must not be used for any DeFi activities.

### 1. Application

  1. Please read our [FAQs](../faq.md), to familiarize yourself with the subtleties of grants, applications and the program as a whole.
   2. [Fork](https://github.com/zk-bankai/SoulForge) our grants program repository.
   3. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the [application template](applications/application-template.md). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the [contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soulforge/soulforge/master/applications/application-template.md) of the template inside the new one. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   4. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   5. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review. Please refer to our [Grant guidelines for most popular grant categories](../Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md) and make sure your deliverables present a similar level of detail.
   6. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_â€”the Markdown file you created from the template.
   7. You will see a comment template that contains a checklist. You can leave it as is and tick the checkboxes once the pull request has been created. Please read through these items and check all of them.


### 2. Application Review

   1. The [committee](/Introduction/team.md) can (and usually does) issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
   2. Clarifications and amendments made in the comments _need to be included in the application_. You may address feedback by directly modifying your application and leaving a comment once you're done. Generally, if you don't reply within 2 weeks, the application will be closed due to inactivity, but you're always free to reopen it as long as it hasn't been rejected.
   3. When all requested changes are addressed and the terms and conditions have been signed, someone will mark your application as `ready for review` and share it internally with the rest of the committee.
   4. The application will be accepted and merged as soon as it receives internal team members approval. Usually this will not take longer than 14-20 days.

### 3. Delivery and Payment

Milestones are monitored from the submitted project's GitHub account. Once a milestone is completed, the SoulForge team will have a 30-minute call with the project team to review the milestone. Upon approval, the grant team will be notified, and the milestone grants will be coordinated accordingly (as mentioned in the application).


## :mailbox_with_mail: Suggest a Project

If you think that we should support the development of certain tools or projects that aren't in the ZK tech stack, feel free to submit a suggestion using the process described below. We are particularly interested in supporting projects that could be leveraged by other builders in our ecosystem.
